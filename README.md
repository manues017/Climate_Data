# 🌍 Climate Change Analysis with Machine Learning

This project presents a data analysis on global climate change, using historical temperature data to build a machine learning model that predicts future temperature trends.

## 📁 Dataset

The original dataset comes from Kaggle:
🔗 Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the full dataset is not included in this repository. However, all results have already been generated in the notebook, so it can be fully explored without downloading additional data.

## 📊 What this notebook includes

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global and city-level temperatures

Visualization of climate trends over the past decades

Machine learning model to predict future temperatures

Interpretation of model results and limitations

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 How to Use

Clone the repository

Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode

Explore the precomputed outputs

📌 No need to re-run the notebook unless you replace the dataset manually.
